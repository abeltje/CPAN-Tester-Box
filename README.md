CPAN::Tester::Box - A CPAN::Tester box based on [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN).

# SYNOPSIS

use CPAN::Tester::Box;

my $recents = CPAN::Tester::RecentUploads->new(
    mirror => 'http://www.cpan.org',
);
my $box = CPAN::Tester::Box->new(
    recent_uploads => $recents,
    poll_interval  => $option{interval},

# DESCRIPTION

This is a very simple CPAN::Tester box. It polls the mirror for new files every
interval (3600 secs by default) and will call `CPAN::Shell->test('$tarball')` via `system()`. Whenever the queue of new files is empty, it will `sleep()`
for the remainder of the polling interval.

By calling `CPAN::Shell->test()`, we assume that you have configured the
CPAN module to create and send test reports (see [CPAN::Reporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN%3A%3AReporter)).

Advice: Run this programme as a separate user on the system, with its own CPAN
configuration. If you choose to install dependencies, use the [local::lib](https://metacpan.org/pod/local%3A%3Alib)
model (or set `PERL_MM_OPT=INST_BASE=/home/<user>/perl5lib` and `PERL_MB_OPT=--install_base /home/<user>/perl5lib` yourself).

**WARNING: By running this programme one agrees to run random code on ones
machine. This can be dangerous for that machine! Make sure the user running it,
can do as little harm as posible.**
